# Twilio Test

Test project for using the Twilio APi, making a post request with the first version and making a get request with the second.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository. In the solution make an Api_Keys.cs file with a public class. Add two public strings to this file, one called AccountSID and the second called AuthToken. Set these to a string of your account information. This should provide the data to the Program.cs and protect your data from appearing in git.
